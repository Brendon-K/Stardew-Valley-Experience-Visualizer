# Stardew-Valley-Experience-Visualizer
This tool is a window separate from Stardew Valley that you can use to check the skill experience for a given character file.

To use this application, download the .jar file and when you run the .jar, it will ask you to select a file. I recommend sorting the list of folders by recently modified so you can better find the correct data if you have multiple characters.

The file you want should have your character name followed by an underscore and a string of numbers. There will be two that look similar, but you want to choose the one that does not say "_old" because the old file isnupdated as often.

Since the character data is only saved at the end of each day, this tool won't automatically update or let you see progress during a day. You will only be able to update after the day ends and the game saves. Due to this there's no auto-update option (yet?) since there's little need to keep polling for updates.
